Snake game with local, online multiplayer, and artificial intelligence (sort of, A* algorithm basically).
The game is a mix between the old school snake and games like slither.io where you can eat your opponents bodies.

All written in Java with no use of Game Engines or some sort of Frameworks, except for the Sound Engine made by 
Niklas Keller (kelunik user)  https://github.com/kelunik/SoundEngine (special thanks to you).
